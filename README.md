# Purposeful Create (Reloaded)

**Automation and industries back in action with impelling purpose!**   
_Now for NeoForge 1.20.1_

## Goal

Purposeful Create (Reloaded) follows the same principle as the original pack.
The original pack became _bogged down_ over time, and difficult to maintain.
Loading would take several minutes, and it was prone to crashing.
Reloaded on the other hand, is much leaner, and is easier to maintain.
It loads in less than a minute, and is much more performant.

Purposeful Create (Reloaded) is a simple modpack that aims to enhance the vanilla experience,
and add some needed difficulty.
Centring around Create with some other fun additions,
filling gaps in the vanilla experience; making your progress feel more purposeful.
New biomes, enemies, and resources to discover and exploit.

My biggest issue with Minecraft is a lack of purpose and incentive for your actions.
The game provides a vast toolbox to carve any world of your choosing.
However the central survival gameplay loop gives no incentive for you to use its toolbox to its full extent.
Create expands on Minecraft's toolbox to the world of engineering extremely organically;
its style is indistinguishable from the base game.
This expanded toolbox can be used to create machines and contraptions,
which most importantly have incentive.
The Create developers share my issue and have done an absolutely fantastic job of remedying it.
